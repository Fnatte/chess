# Chess

This is a chess game written in JavaScript using the Cycle.js framework
and Ramda library. The purpose of this application is purely
self-educational, as I experiment with Cycle.js and a more functional
programming style.

## Getting Started

```shell
npm install
npm test
npm run lint
npm start
```

And then browse to http://localhost:8080.
